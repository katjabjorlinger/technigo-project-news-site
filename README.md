# News Site
A responsive blog website showcasing travel-related content. This project focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Description ✒️
This project is part of a web development assignment aimed at building a modern, responsive website. 
The site includes key sections such as:
* A hero section to capture the user's attention.
* A blog grid to display various travel articles.
* A quote section to inspire the reader.
* An Instagram-inspired gallery styled like Polaroids.
* A resource section with helpful travel guides and tools.
* A contact form in the footer for user inquiries.

The design emphasizes a clean layout, usability, and responsiveness.

## Tools and Techniques 🛠️
* HTML5 for structure.
* CSS3 with Flexbox and Grid for layout and responsiveness.
* Font Awesome for icons.
* Media Queries to ensure the site adapts to various screen sizes.
* Custom CSS Variables for consistent theming and easy adjustments.
* Visual Studio Code as the primary code editor.

## Planning 📌
1. Sketched an initial wireframe for the layout.
2. Identified key sections and their purpose.
3. Implemented the site section by section, focusing on responsiveness from the start.
4. Regularly tested across different screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience.

## Future Improvements ✅
